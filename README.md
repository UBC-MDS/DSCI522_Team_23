# Prediction of Wine Quality based on physicochemical tests 

### Data

The data sets used in this project are of the prediction of wine quality based on physicochemical tests, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The data were created by Paulo Cortez at the University of Minho, Guimarães, Portugal. It was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Dua and Graff 2017) and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality), specifically this [file](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/). The data provided only have physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). There are a total of 4898 number of instances in our combined dataset of red wine and white wine.
