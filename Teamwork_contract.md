This document governs how team-members will work together through friendly, through close and efficient communication. 

## Work and workload

Work should be conducted in accordance with UBC and MDS disciplinary and academic requirements and standards. 
Team-members will distribute the work in a fair and efficient manner. We will abide by the following practices:

 - Timely and clear communication 

To accomplish each milestone, team-members will set expectations of division of work through clear communication.
Team-members should actively let the whole team know about their preferences, concerns and difficulties.
We acknowledge that extra work will naturally come up unexpectedly during the course of the project. 

 - Difficulties and unforeseen circusntances 
 
Also, it is completely legitimate for team-members to experience difficulties in the project itself, or for other academic and personal reasons. 
Under such circumstances, team-members should communicate as soon as possible with the whole team, so that necessary adjustments can be made. 
The team should be understanding of such circumstances. 
Team-members are encouraged to pick up extra work, and the team should show appreciation. 

 - Expect working hours
 
Team-members are expected to work on the project for at least 10 hours per week. 
We acknowledge that sometimes extra time and effort is needed for the project. However, we believe that team-members should also balance other MDS commitments and their overall health. 
The team should acknowledge extra work and effort made by team-members, and generously share appreciation. 

## Meetings

We believe that efficient meetings are the cornorstone of success at this course and collaborative projects at MDS in general. We highly value the skills that we obtain from organizing and participating in meetings for this course. 

 - Timing
 
The team will meet through video conferencing twice every week. Below is the meeting schedule (Vancouver time): 

| Day      | Time      | Leader1             | Leader 2           |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Tuesday  | 1pm - 2pm | Jiajie (Joshua) Lim | Ling (Elina) Lin   |
| Thursday | 1pm - 2pm | Jiacheng Wang       | Kangyu (Mark) Wang |

 - Content and format
 
In the first meeting of a week, we will briefly overview the week's work and set expectations. All team-members should familiarize themselves with the milestone requirements beforehand the meeting. 
The bulk of meeting time will be dedicated to reaching consensus over the skeleton of the week's work, as well as appropriate timelines. Each team member can expect to know which part of the work to work on after the meeting. 

All team-members are expected to have started their parts of the work by the time of second meeting, which should take place on Thursday. The first part of the second meeting should be focused on reporting work progress and identify necessary adjustments to the overall workplan. Team-members are expected to be engaged in listening and giving their feedback.
The second part of the second meeting is dedicated to discussing each team-member's direction of work for the latter half of the week. 

 - Leadership
 
The first meeting should occur on Monday or Tuesday Vancouver time. For each meeting, two team-members will rotate to undertake the leadership role. 
The meeting leader should briefly set and share the meeting agenda before the meeting, and take meeting notes. 
Meeting notes should be cleaned and shared on the team's repository within 3 hours after the meeting. 

## Standards of Product

We believe in the highest achievable standard of product for the project to accomplish the course goals.

 - Priority skill development goals

The team understand that the purpose of this course is to develop an understanding and experience with teamwork best practices in a software development and data analytics context. 
Therefore, all team-members should prioritize the transparency and reproducibility of the project, as well as collaboration. 
The team believes that the analysis itself should be solid, and meet all formatting standards set by the course teaching team. 
The team does not expect itself to conduct in-depth or comprehensive analyses. 

 - Key details
 
Taking into account MDS's overall curricular design and purposes, the team will be mindful of the following detais throughout the project:

(a) The correct use of Github forks with appropriate committing and pushing operations,

(b) Strong attention of team-member's work, and seeking, providing and appreciating constructive feedback through Github issues instead of Slack, and 

(c) Comprehensive understanding of files and the directory structure.


## Availability of teammembers

Team-members should dedicate themselves in a healthy manner to the project, like to all other MDS commitments. 
We maintain full-time commitment to communication from team-members. Taking into account time zone differences, the following table will guide the temporal aspect of communication among the team (Vancouver time):

| Team-member         | Time dedicated to the project | Time able to reply messages and answer questions | Time unavailable |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Jiajie (Joshua) Lim |                               |                                                  |                  |
| Ling (Elina) Lin    |                               |                                                  |                  |
| Jiacheng Wang       |                               |                                                  |                  |
| Kangyu (Mark) Wang  | 1 pm - 12 pm                  | 12 pm - 4 am                                     | 4 am - 1 pm      |

When unforeseen circumstances arise, they should be made known to the whole team as soon as possible.
